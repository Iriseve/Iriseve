# About Me
- 👋 Hi, I’m @yiling

- 🌱 My current research focuses on large language models (LLMx), with particular interest in reasoning and agent related topics, in addition to (multimodal) hallucination suppression, multi-agent cooperation and LLM knowledge related problems. Anyway, my interests are more extensive, welcome to discuss some interesting work together!
- 💞️ I am very interested in communicating and collaborating with researchers interested in it. If you would like to discuss further, please feel free to contact me via email, and I will respond as soon as possible.
